Hi folks,

Today I decided to come back to here and to post about what I am doing.

Blogging is always something that I want to care but I never allow time to do so. I tried to use Blogger which is still easy to use and good to start with. But it does not provide the control about style, posts and so on.

After awhile, I came up with wordpress on a shared hosting. It did seem to good to go with because I got the power. However, It's so complicated to go with. I gave up it and moved back to blogger but I don't want to post anymore. 

Two or three weeks ago, I discovered Jekyll and it seems really easy to manage and give me the control of every single thing. I am now going on discovering. 

I am planning to post about what I recently learnt and usefull information about the following up topics:
* Software Engineering
    * How to design
    * Design Patterns
    * Clean Coding
* Programming Languages
    * Python
    * C/C++
    * Octave
    * R
* Data Science
    * Machine Learning
    * Data Analysis

I would also share about my life :) 

Till the next post, take care! 
Take Care,
Bartu
